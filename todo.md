Overall
-------

Define sets of requirements for different scenarios.

OD
--

MP, HH: get STK and look at stable orbits

Constellation Design
--------------------

Region of interest or uniform global coverage?  tradeoffs?  Dynamic
ROIs?

Timing
------

Is an OCXO good enough?
  - HH: What's the drift rate look like?  What error models are good?

MP: What does NIST use quasars for for timing?

MP: Calcs on observability and error bounds for timing

Positioning
-----------

BM: What does the user algorithm look like?  What is different about
the error models?

HH: What other features of updated GNSS signals do you want?

Comms
-----

RK: Laser cross-links vs. radio cross-links?

What are the bandwidth, latency and availability requirements for
 - positioning/timing only?
 - comms?
 - weather?
